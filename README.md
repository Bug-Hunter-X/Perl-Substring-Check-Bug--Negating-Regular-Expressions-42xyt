This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl when checking for the absence of substrings using regular expressions. The `bug.pl` file contains incorrect code, while `bugSolution.pl` shows the correct approach.  The issue arises from the way Perl's `!~` operator works with regular expressions.  The solution uses the `index()` function for more explicit and reliable substring checking. This is a good example of a subtle Perl bug that can lead to unexpected behavior.
